## Structure of the code

In src we have 3 folders:
- Bot - for the bot related classes:
                        <Class.java>    // write the names of the classes
                        <Class.java>
- Implementation - for the implementation classes:
                        <Class.java>
                        <Class.java>
                        <Class.java>
- UI - for the user interface classes:
                        <Class.java>
                        <Class.java>
- A class <App.java> that runs the program

## How it works

// Explain what it does and how to play.



## Getting Started
Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.
## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
## Dependency Management
The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
